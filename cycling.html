    <h2 class="cycling">Track cycling</h2>
    <p class="cycling">Track cycling is more then six days with beer and "braadworst".
        In a six day the cyclists are payed to perform and entertain the crowd.
        At real races they only have to race to set a result.
        There are many different disciplines, some more attractive then others.
    <br>Also the bike is not like a normal racebike.
        To start the are no gears or brakes.
        You can't stop peddaling, the only way to slow down is to peddal slower.
        The bike is made to go fast on a straight line, even in the corners of a track you just steer straight.
        Some strange physics law will work on you and youre bike to make the corners</p>

    <p class="cycling clear">I'll try to explain some of the most common disciplines</p>
    <ul class="cycling">
      <li class="cycling">
        Keirin
      </li>
      <p class="cyclinglist">The most spectacular discipline, where 6 riders start with some laps behind a derny en sprint to the finish.
        The riders can do almost anything, but have the keep ther hands on the handlebars.
        Pushing with the shoulders, headbuts, high speeds and a lot of crashes make this a entertaining thing to watch </p>
      <li class="cycling">
        Scratch
      </li>
      <p class="cyclinglist">A normal race, the first at the finish wins the race </p>
      <li class="cycling">
        Points race
      </li "cycling">
      <p class="cyclinglist">A race where not the first crossing the line wins, but the racer who has won the most points during the racing.
        Every few laps there is a sprint to earn 5,3,2 an 1 point and the final sprint you can earn double points.
        If you lap the peleton you earn 20 points</p>
      <li class="cycling">
        Madison
      </li>
      <p class="cyclinglist">A relay race, like a points race.
        One rider races in the lower part of the track, the other stays high and rest.
        They may releive each other anytime </p>
      <li class="cycling">
        Pursuit
      </li>
      <p class="cyclinglist">A time trail, there is a individual and team pursuit. Always 2km (for youth), 3km (U23 and women) or 4km (elite) </p>
      <li class="cycling">
        Flying 200m
