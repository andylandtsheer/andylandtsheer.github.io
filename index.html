            <span class="justme">Previous jobs : </span> I've been in te army for almost 13 years.
            Did mostly construction works and the last few years I worked in a garage as a mechanic.
            I did 2 tours of duty in Lebanon, and some weeks in Brussels and Antwerp.
            My nickname in the army is " De Facteur". Got this name when they found out I worked as a mailmen before joining the army.
